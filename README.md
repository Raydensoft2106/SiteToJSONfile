Hudson Commerce JSON test
Hudson Developer Test

We have set up a grocery store at:
https://dev-test.hudsonstaging.co.uk/ 
Using any programming language that you wish, please scrape the website, download the products, convert them to JSON, and then save them to a file.
The JSON format must match the following:
 

[
    {
        "product": "Eggs",
"metadata": {
    "image_url": "https://image.url",
    "quantity": 5,
    "price": 10
}
    }
]
